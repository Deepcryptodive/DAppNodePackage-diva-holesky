  "description": "Diva is an Ethereum Liquid Staking protocol powered by Distributed Validator Technology (DVT).\n\nIt extends Ethereum's Proof of Stake providing new functionality for Stakers and Operators:\n\n- **Liquid Stakers** receive divETH, a [Liquid Staking Token](https://docs.divastaking.net/lst) which accrues Ethereum [Staking Rewards](https://docs.divastaking.net/staking-rewards).\n- **Operators** run a [**Di**stributed **Va**lidation node](https://docs.divastaking.net/operators) to fulfill staking duties and earn additional [Operator Rewards](https://docs.divastaking.net/economics).\n\nEthereum's staking rewards are distributed among the Diva network participants according to their contributions.\n\ndivETH is a receipt token and its balance updates daily to reflect the deposited ETH balance plus its accrued Ethereum staking rewards.\n\nWhile other solutions have some of these features, **Diva is the first solution that fully integrates Liquid Staking with [Distributed Validation](https://docs.divastaking.net/dvt)**, offering both Liquid Stakers and Operators the most efficient functionality.",
